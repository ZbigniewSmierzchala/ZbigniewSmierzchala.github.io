                <p>I am a competitive tennis player and during the warming-up phase and in the first minutes of the match I am analyzing the opponent’s strengths and weaknesses and develop a strategy to win the match. I analyze the skills of my opponent and his physical and mental fitness. How does my opponent deal with high spin balls on the backhand? How he reacts when I am storming to the net?  Tennis and other sports professionals do the same, just on a different level. </p>
                
                <p>However, the winning strategy can work only if you have done an honest assessment, not fooling yourself. If your backhand is weak, you can not just declare it`s great, you will lose points quickly and finally lost the game.</p>
                
                <p>The same applies to business. The strengths and weakness analysis must be honest and supported by proof points, facts, and data, as well as by external / customer feedback, not just internal opinions, which might be (often just unconsciously) biased.</p>
                
                <p> That honest SWOT assessment helps to identify differentiation points and define a compelling value proposition. The next challenge lies in the communication to the market.</p>
                <p> As buyers (especially in the B2B markets) are well informed, it makes sense to approach the competitive positioning in an honest way directly. There is practically no chance that customers are not aware of competitive offerings at all.</p>
                <p> With the open approach to the competitive positioning, the vendor is building trust and credibility and trust is one of the primary currencies in business. “When customers trust a brand, they are more likely to do business with them and can eventually turn into loyal brand advocates. B2B customers want to make sure they get exactly what they need, and that it matches their budget, says a study conducted by  TrustRadius. According to the research, free trials, product demos, and user reviews are the most trustworthy and influential resources for buyers.</p>

                <p> Some companies, especially in the SaaS markets, publish information on why to choose their products and how they stack up to competitors on their homepages. A great example provides 
                    <a href="https://www.meistertask.com/pages/find-out-why#competitorcomparison" target="_blank">MeisterTask </a>, 
                a SaaS company providing online task management tools for teams.             
                </p>
            
               <p>The company provides a dedicated section to call out why to choose its product and how it differentiates from the competition. The claims are backed up by customer statements, where it makes sense. In a nutshell, the company claims to have the most intuitive and efficient product.                    
               </p>
                
                <p>The company addresses key competitors’ strengths in a clever way, actually supporting its own value proposition message.  Here is an example to give you an idea:</p>
                
                <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Competitor</th>
      <th>MeisterTask ´s assessment</th>
      <th>Competitors own statement</th>
      
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Jira</td>
      <td> Most developer-oriented. “Jira is tailored to agile/scrum team workflows. Those teams usually have the technical knowledge to administer it in-house, and the money to spend on it”
</td>
        <td>Jira Software is built for every member of your software team to plan,track, and release great software.
</td>
      </tr>         
</tbody> 
 </table>

                <p>As there are many task management tools there, the final goal is to manage expectations and attract customers to make a trial. </p>
                <p> Would you agree that customers looking for easy-to-use while feature-reach task management will be very likely attracted by <a href="https://www.meistertask.com/pages/find-out-why#competitorcomparison" target="_blank"> <strong> MeisterTask</strong> </a> arguments? </p>
